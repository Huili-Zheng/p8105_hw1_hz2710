```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:

 a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
 a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
 a character vector of length 10
 a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”


```{r}
 a = c(rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1))
 b = a > 0
 c = vector("character", length = 10)
 d = factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high",  "low", "medium", "high"))
 
 answer1.data <- data.frame(a, b, c, d)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
